# Network_analyzer_scapy
The project is a Python script leveraging the Scapy library to conduct an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) scan within a specified local network subnet. It systematically sends ARP requests to all IP addresses in the defined range, collects responses from active devices, and compiles a list displaying the discovered devices' IP and MAC addresses in a user-friendly tabular format. This tool is valuable for network administrators managing local network inventories, security professionals conducting security audits, and as an educational resource for understanding ARP scanning techniques.
